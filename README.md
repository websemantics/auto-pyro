    ----  PyroCMS Deploy Tool v1.2 --- ooO--(_)--Ooo ----
```

> This is a [PyroCMS 3](https://www.pyrocms.com/) deploy tool with customization, install automation, better version control setup and other nice-to-have features.

## Get Started

Auto-pyro downloads, configures, installs and deploys a complete Pyro app with optional / required addons and packages. It automatically installs [Pyro Builder](https://github.com/websemantics/builder-extension) and comes pre-configured with a [todo module](#todo-module) example out of the box.

Here's a video to demonstrate how it works (click on the image)

[![Auto pyro, a deploy tool for Pyro 3](http://img.youtube.com/vi/rP0YVmAeE58/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP0YVmAeE58)

And, the following steps sum-up what was achieved in the video,

1- Install [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/),

```bash
brew install ant
```

Apache Ant is an awesome build tool and despite its seemingly dated xml format, it can achieve great feats. [Tutsplus](https://tutsplus.com/) has a great article called, [Automate your Projects with Apache Ant](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/automate-your-projects-with-apache-ant--net-18595) to introduce the tool to new comers. 

2- Clone this repository into `my-app`,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/websemantics/auto-pyro my-app
```

3- Add other project files, for example, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `LICENSE.md` etc,

4- Configure the properties file,`./local.properties` with database settings (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for more details). The script will create a fresh database every time it runs,

5- Deploy the app by executing the command `ant` in the project folder,

```bash
cd my-app
ant
```

Set back until the deploy process is complete. Browse to the project to view, for example, http://my-app.dev.

A setup switch `setup` is available for you to only install Pyro.

```bash
ant -Dsetup=false
```

The deploy process will skip cloning PyroCMS repo, requiring plugins and composer packages.

## Todo Module

This is a simple module that is used to demonstrate features of Auto-pyro and [Pyro Builder](https://github.com/websemantics/builder-extension),

It is achieved as the result of executing a number of artisan commands as follows,

```bash
# Start with scaffolding a new module,
php artisan make:addon websemantics.module.todo,

# Make a stream and fields migrations,
php artisan make:stream 'task:tc(name),name,description:t(anomaly.field_type.textarea),completed:t(anomaly.field_type.boolean)' websemantics.module.todo

# Finally, install the module, .. done!
php artisan module:install websemantics.module.todo
```

Check `env.ARTISAN` in the properties files  `./local.properties` for details. Also, make sure to remove this line if you're using Auto-pyro in your own project.

## Motivation

Here's a list of why this project can be of help when working with PyroCMS 3, mainly nice to have features that reduce the workload required when starting new projects,

- We don't always need to install, migrate or seed all PyroCMS core addons. For example, not seeding the `Pages` module will allow us to use the project [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) views instead.

- When building an app or a website with PyroCMS most of the project code commonly located in the well-recognized `./addons` folder. However, we often end-up tracking [app boilerplate](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/lifecycle) code from [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and PyroCMS core modules (located at `./core`) plus many other files in the project Github repository.

- To gain the ability to have project own `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `LICENSE.md` files instead of the framework defaults.

- Oftentimes we need to install third-party modules, themes and other addons from Github but end-up installing them manually and track them in the project Github repository.  

- Find it somewhat inconvenient to install dependencies for third-party/our own addons  ([Bower](https://bower.io/), [NPM](http://npmjs.com/), [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), etc) or run build tasks (i.e [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)) after every install.

- Call it lazy, but, installing and deploying a PyroCMS project completely from the command line would be an absolute pleasure.

- Building Admin interfaces for new project modules / extensions can be time consuming. Having a build process that can take [migration files](https://www.pyrocms.com/documentation/streams-platform/migrations) and turn them into admin UIs would be nice.

- And last but not least, how about the ability to encode your application modules and streams into the DNA of your auto-pyro install so that they are ready after each install?

## Environment Variables

To configure the deploy process, change properties values in `./local.properties`, located at the root folder,

Here's a quick list of the PyroCOM Environment properties,

| Property        | Value           |Description           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| APPLICATION_NAME | `default` | Set to `Default` by default |
| APPLICATION_DOMAIN |   `localhost`    |  Change as appropriate |
| APPLICATION_REFERENCE |   `default`   | Set to `default` by default  |
| APP_URL |   `default.dev`   | Set to `{APPLICATION_NAME}.dev` by default |
| ADMIN_USERNAME | `admin` | Set to `admin` by default |
| ADMIN_EMAIL | `admin@admin.com` | Set to `admin@admin.com` by default |
| ADMIN_PASSWORD | `secret` | Set to `secret` by default |
| DB_DATABASE | `pyro` | Set to `pyro` by default |
| DB_USERNAME | `root` | Change as appropriate |
| DB_PASSWORD | `root` | Change as appropriate |
| DB_CONNECTION | `mysql` | Set to `mysql` by default |

Configuration of core addons

| Property        | Example           |Description           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| SEED_EXCLUDES | `pages,variables` | Comma-separated list of modules or extensions to be excluded from seeding |
| MODULE_EXCLUDES | `pages`,`post` |  Don't install modules (comma-separated list) |
| EXTENSION_EXCLUDES | `default_page_handler`,`page_link_type`  | Don't install extensions (comma-separated list) |

## Deploy Script

The deploy script is written for [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) and can be found at `./build.xml`.

#### Targets

Targets are equivalent to `methods` in PHP. When the `ant` command is invoked, it looks for `./build.xml` at the current folder and runs the `default` target.

To get a list of targets,

```bash
ant -projecthelp
```

To better understand the deploy script in `build.xml`, here's a list of all the targets included, their dependencies and order of execution,


| Order         | Target        | Description   | Dependencies |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| 10 | `default` | The default target to start project deploy |`install` |
| 9 | `install` | Deploys this project and runs post deploy tasks | `run-artisan-commands` |
| 8 | `run-artisan-commands` | Run artisan commands | `require-install-addons` |
| 7 | `require-install-addons` | Requires and installs project addons and all the front-end, css, npm, grunt libraries | `install-pyro` |
| 6 | `install-pyro` | Installs PyroCMS by running migrations, installing/seeding core modules/addons and creating the project .env file | `create-database` |
| 5 | `create-database` | Create database | `require-composer` |
| 4 | `require-composer` | Requires all composer dependencies | `require-pyro` |
| 3 | `require-pyro` | Clones PyroCMS and copy its files to project folder | `clean` |
| 2 | `clean` | Delete `temp` folders and the project .env file | `init` |
| 1 | `init` | Loads project properties, task definitions and other environment settings | * |

There are few empty targets with examples to use with common tasks, for example, install, uninstall or reinstall the project addons when in development mode,

| Target        | Description     | Dependencies |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| `install-addons` | Install project addons | `init` |
| `uninstall-addons` | Uninstall project addons | `init` |
| `reinstall-addons` | Reinstall project addons |  `init` |

The remaining tasks are experiential and still work in progress,

| Target        | Description     | Dependencies |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| `install-laravel` | Install PyroCMS on top of Laravel |`require-laravel` |
| `require-laravel` | Clones Laravel and copy all files to project folder |`init`,`clean` |
| `update-database` | Update database with liquibase schema |`init` |
